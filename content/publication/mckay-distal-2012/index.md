abstract: The present study examined the effectiveness of distal versus proximal external
  foci of attention as a function of performers' preferences for a certain focus.
  We used a dart throwing task, and participants were instructed to direct their attention
  either to the target (distal focus) or the flight of the dart (proximal focus).
  Participants were asked to select their preferred focus after one trial under each
  focus condition without knowledge of results. Subsequently, all participants performed
  two 24-trial blocks, one under each condition, with focus order (preferred first
  vs. non-preferred) counterbalanced. Significantly more participants preferred the
  distal compared to the proximal focus. Also, dart throwing accuracy was generally
  enhanced when participants adopted a distal focus, regardless of focus order or
  preference. The present findings provide further evidence that the “distance” effect
  in attentional focus is a general phenomenon that does not depend on individual
  preferences.
