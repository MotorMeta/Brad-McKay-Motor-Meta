abstract: While research has identified several practice variables that purportedly
  enhance motor learning, recent replication failures highlight the importance of
  conducting high-powered, pre-registered replications. The \"expecting to teach\"
  phenomenon was first reported in the motor learning literature by Daou and colleagues
  and suggested learners benefit from practicing with the understanding they will
  later need to teach the skill. The extant data have been mixed but generally positive.
  While expecting to teach has been shown to enhance motor learning of a golf putt,
  the mechanisms linked with this benefit are yet to be determined. As such, this
  study sought to replicate the expecting to teach effect and to extend those findings
  by exploring participantsâ€™ thought processes. Participants (N = 76) were randomly
  assigned to one of two groups in which they were told that they were learning a
  golf putt in order to 1) be tested on the skill or 2) teach the skill to another
  individual. On Day 1, participants completed pre-test putts, a pre-acquisition intrinsic
  motivation inventory (IMI), a 2-minute study of an instructional booklet, 50 practice
  putts and a post-acquisition IMI. During practice, participants were also afforded
  opportunities to continue studying the booklet and to complete additional putts.
  Participants returned 24 hours later to complete a retention, a transfer (50-cm
  longer golf-putt), and a free recall test, as well as a post-study survey to reveal
  thoughts they engaged in after practice but before (or during) the retention test.
  Similar to Daou et al., no significant differences were found with study time, number
  of acquisition putts, or motivation. However, golf-putting performance during retention
  resulted in no differences for radial error, g = -0.13 (95% C.I. [-0.55, 0.29]),
  between the two groups and no differences were shown for the recall test. The present
  study fails to replicate the benefits reported in the original experiments.
