abstract: "The self-invoking trigger hypothesis was proposed by Wulf and Lewthwaite\
  \ [Wulf, G., & Lewthwaite, R. (2010). Effortless motor learning? An external focus\
  \ of attention enhances movement effectiveness and efficiency. In B. Bruya (Ed.),\
  \ Effortless attention: A new perspective in attention and action (pp. 75–101).\
  \ Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] as a mechanism underlying the robust effect of attentional\
  \ focus on motor learning and performance. One component of this hypothesis, relevant\
  \ beyond the attentional focus effect, suggests that causing individuals to access\
  \ their self-schema will negatively impact their learning and performance of a motor\
  \ skill. The purpose of the present two studies was to provide an initial test of\
  \ the performance and learning aspects of the self-invoking trigger hypothesis by\
  \ asking participants in one group to think about themselves between trial blocks—presumably\
  \ activating their self-schema—to compare their performance and learning to that\
  \ of a control group. In Experiment 1, participants performed 2 blocks of 10 trials\
  \ on a throwing task. In one condition, participants were asked between blocks to\
  \ think about their past throwing experience. While a control group maintained their\
  \ performance across blocks, the self group's performance was degraded on the second\
  \ block. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to practice a wiffleball hitting\
  \ task on two separate days. Participants returned on a third day to perform retention\
  \ and transfer tests without the self-activating manipulation. Results indicated\
  \ that the self group learned the hitting task less effectively than the control\
  \ group. The findings reported here provide initial support for the self-invoking\
  \ trigger hypothesis."
