abstract: 'Purpose: The Optimizing Performance Through Motivation and Attention for
  Learning (OPTIMAL) theory predicts that providing learners with choices during skill
  acquisition will enhance their acquisition performance, motor learning, and expectancies.
  Based on this theory, it is recommended that instructors ask learners to choose
  which tasks to practice in applied settings. This experiment tested these predictions
  and recommendation by crossing autonomy support with practice schedule in a 2 ×
  2 factorial design. Method: Participants (N = 128) practiced a novel non-dominant
  hand dart-throwing task either with choice over the color of the dart flights (autonomy)
  or yoked to a counterpart’s choices (yoked). Further, participants either practiced
  throwing darts to three different targets in equal amounts (variable) or throwing
  to the same target for all practice trials (constant). All participants completed
  a pretest, acquisition phase, 24-hr delayed retention and transfer tests, as well
  as baseline and post-acquisition autonomy, and self-efficacy measures. Data were
  analyzed according to a pre-registered analysis plan that included pretest and gender
  as covariates. Results: The autonomy groups reported significantly greater perceived
  autonomy at the end of acquisition. There were no significant effects of autonomy
  on self-efficacy, or motor performance uniquely during acquisition, or uniquely
  on the delayed transfer test. The autonomy groups, however, performed with significantly
  greater error across acquisition and transfer. Practice schedule interacted with
  the time of testing such that the constant groups performed significantly more accurately
  during acquisition but non-significantly less accurately during transfer than the
  variable groups. Conclusions: These results are inconsistent with OPTIMAL theory.'
