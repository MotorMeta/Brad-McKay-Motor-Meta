abstract: Beyond skill, beliefs in requisite abilities and expectations can affect
  performance. This study examined effects of induced perceptions of ability to perform
  well under generic situations of challenge. Participants (N = 31) first completed
  one block of 20 trials on a throwing accuracy task. They then completed questionnaires
  ostensibly measuring individual differences in the ability to perform under pressure.
  Enhanced-expectancy group participants were told that they were well-suited to perform
  under pressure, while the control group received neutral information. Subsequently,
  all participants completed another block of 20 trials on the throwing task, with
  their performance being videotaped and under the assumption that they could secure
  a prize for themselves and a paired participant with successful performance. Both
  groups had similar accuracy scores on the first trial block. The enhanced-expectancy
  group significantly increased their throwing accuracy in the high-pressure situation
  (second block), whereas the control group showed no change in performance. Furthermore,
  beliefs regarding performance under challenge predicted throwing accuracy on the
  second block. The present findings provide evidence that enhancing individualsâ€™
  generic expectancies regarding performance under pressure can affect their motor
  performance.
