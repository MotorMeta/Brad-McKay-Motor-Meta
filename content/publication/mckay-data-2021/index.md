abstract: We present a critical re-analysis of five implicit learning papers published
  by the same authors between 2010 and 2021. We calculated effect sizes for each pairwise
  comparison reported in the papers using the data published in each article. We further
  identified mathematically impossible data reported in multiple papers, either with
  deductive logic or by conducting a GRIMMER analysis of reported means and standard
  deviations. We found the pairwise effect sizes were implausible in all five articles
  in question, with Cohenâ€™s d values often exceeding 100 and sometimes exceeding 1000.
  Impossible statistics were reported in four out of the five articles. Reported test
  statistics and eta-squared values were also implausible, with several eta-squared
  = .99 and even eta-squared = 1.0 for between-subjects main effects. The results
  reported in the five articles in question are unreliable. Many of the problems we
  identified could be spotted without further analysis, highlighting the need for
  adequate statistical training in the field of motor learning.
