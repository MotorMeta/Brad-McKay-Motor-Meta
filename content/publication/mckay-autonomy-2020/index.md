abstract: Optimizing Performance Through Intrinsic Motivation and Attention for Learning
  (OPTIMAL) Theory proposes that choices of any kind support an individual's need
  for autonomy, motivating them to learn and perform motor skills more effectively.
  Notably, the authors suggest asking learners to choose when to receive feedback
  in order to increase autonomy. Conversely, the guidance hypothesis predicts an impact
  of feedback schedule independent of motivational influences. The purpose of this
  experiment was to compare the relative and combined effects of autonomy and feedback
  schedule for the acquisition of a golf putting task without vision of results. Autonomy
  support (autonomy support vs. yoked) and knowledge of results (KR) schedule (100%-KR
  vs. 50%-faded-KR) were combined in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Participants (N = 56)
  in the autonomy support groups were asked to choose from three colours of golf balls
  for each putt during 10 acquisition blocks. Yoked groups were yoked to the golf
  ball colour choices of their autonomy support group counterparts. Participants in
  the 100%-feedback schedule groups were provided x- and y-coordinate KR following
  every putt during acquisition, while participants in the 50%-faded groups received
  KR after half of their putts, with feedback frequency decreasing over acquisition
  blocks. All participants completed a 24-h delayed retention and transfer test without
  KR. The results were somewhat consistent with OPTIMAL Theory yet the effects were
  not statistically significant and trivially small. The results were inconsistent
  with the guidance hypothesis.
