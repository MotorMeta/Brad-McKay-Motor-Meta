This technique evaluates whether the reported means of integer data such as Likert-type scales are consistent with the given sample size and number of items. We tested this technique with a sample of 260 recent empirical articles in leading journals. Of the articles that we could test with the {GRIM} technique (N ¼ 71), around half (N ¼ 36) appeared to contain at least one inconsistent mean, and more than 20\% (N ¼ 16) contained multiple such inconsistencies. We requested the data sets corresponding to 21 of these articles, receiving positive responses in 9 cases. We confirmed the presence of at least one reporting error in all cases, with three articles requiring extensive corrections. The implications for the reliability and replicability of empirical psychology are discussed.},

Our results, on the basis of 281 articles, indicate that around 18\% of statistical results in the psychological literature are incorrectly reported. Inconsistencies were more common in low-impact journals than in high-impact journals. Moreover, around 15\% of the articles contained at least one statistical conclusion that proved, upon recalculation, to be incorrect; that is, recalculation rendered the previously significant result insignificant, or vice versa.

	abstract = {To date, research concerning analogy, implicit and explicit instruction has focused on perceptual or motor skills with limited attention directed toward psychological skills such as self-efficacy or their interaction with motor skill performance. The present study investigated the effect of analogy, implicit and explicit methods on the acquisition and retention of a volleyball motor skill (reception), and self-efficacy for novices. Eighty female novices, aged from 10 to 11 years, were randomly selected and assigned to four equal groups (three experimental and one control). A pre-test, three different intervention programs of 12 training units (4 weeks X 3 times per week), according to the different learning methods, a post-test, and a retention test were conducted. Volleyball reception skill was measured via a field test (Wulf, {McConnel}, Gärtner \& Schwarz, 2002), and self-efficacy was measured via a questionnaire (Theodorakis, 1996). A two-way (4 groups X 3 tests) mixed factorial analysis of variance ({ANOVA}) and a post hoc Tukey test were used to analyze the data. The results showed that all three methods improved both motor skill and self-efficacy of novices over time. Comparing groups showed that the analogy learning group achieved the highest score in the retention test for both motor performance and self-efficacy. Moreover, the implicit group was better than the explicit and the control group. Analogy learning seems to be a promising instructional method for the improvement of both motor skills and self-efficacy. The participants in the analogy and implicit learning groups probably had limited access to declarative knowledge and, according to the "reinvestment hypothesis", they did not overload their working memory and did not block the automated process of performance. Additionally, when analogy learners received instructions to imitate a familiar form of movement pattern, this created a sense of success and pleasure which probably positively influenced their self-efficacy. Conversely, according to the "optimal theory", the improved self-efficacy of the analogy learners probably positively influenced the goal-setting procedure, which led to higher motivation and better performance. These results suggest that the analogy learning method has a positive effect on self-efficacy, which has been overlooked by previous studies in the motor learning literature, and is also positively correlated with motor skill performance.},

A field and a laboratory test were conducted to evaluate decision-making on the volleyball serve skill (decide and move). Once the four groups completed the pre-test, the three experimental groups participated in the intervention programme consisting of 12 training units (4 weeks X 3 times per week). A post-test, a retention test, and a stress test were also applied to all groups. All experimental groups improved and retained decision-making scores in both the laboratory and the field tests. Comparing the groups showed that the analogy learning group achieved a higher score than the implicit, explicit, and control groups in the post-test and retention test. Analogy and implicit learners appear to be unaffected by stress conditions, while the opposite is true of the explicit learners’ performance, which decreased in both in the laboratory and the field tests. Ιt seems that if taught by analogy-based instructions, novices may perform better at both decision-making and motor skills, which indicates that they are under less cognitive demand, even under stress conditions.},

The participants were 60 female novices, ages 10 to 12 years. The experimental groups followed three different methods of training: (a) explicit practice for the development of declarative knowledge, (b) implicit practice for the development of the procedural knowledge, (c) sequential practice (implicit first and then explicit), and (d) control group that participated only in the measurements. A pre-test, a post-test, and a retention test measured the response time and accuracy of the decision-making skill. Analysis indicated that all experimental groups improved over time while the control group did not. The sequential group was faster and more accurate than the implicit group, and the latter was faster and more accurate than the explicit one. The sequential group outperformed implicit and explicit groups on both speed and accuracy of decision. It seems that both explicit and implicit processes, when they take place in sequence, interact positively, and this method improves speed and accuracy of decision making rather than when each mode of learning (implicit or explicit) occurs separately. If the role of working memory is reduced at the early stages of learning, the accumulation of declarative knowledge (explicit learning) may benefit from accumulation of procedural knowledge and enhance decision-making skill.},

However, when novices have both goals, outcome usually prevails over form. External over internal focus of attention has been proposed by many researchers as an effective method for the development and learning of movement form or outcome. In this study, 57 girls were randomly divided into 2 experimental groups (external and internal) and a control group. All groups performed a pre-test. The two experimental groups followed an intervention program for 12 training units (6 weeks X 2 times a week). A post-test and a transfer test followed two weeks later. Data were analysed by factorial {ANOVA} (3 groups X 3 measurements) with repeated measurements of the last factor, followed by a post-hoc Tukey test. Both experimental groups, but not the control group, improved their performance in both form and outcome from pre-test to post-test and transfer test. The external focus group scored better in both form and outcome than the internal focus group in the post and transfer tests. It seems that external focus drives a subconscious motor control that results in greater movement automaticity and improves both form and outcome of sport skills. It is concluded that the external focus method is appropriate to develop both form and outcome of perceptual-motor skills.},

	shorttitle = {The {GRIMMER} test},
	abstract = {{GRIMMER} (Granularity-Related Inconsistency of Means Mapped to Error Repeats) builds upon the {GRIM} test and allows for testing whether reported measures of variability are mathematically possible. {GRIMMER} relies upon the statistical phenomenon that variances display a simple repetitive pattern when the data is discrete, i.e. granular. This observation allows for the generation of an algorithm that can quickly identify whether a reported statistic of any size or precision is consistent with the stated sample size and granularity. My implementation of the test is available at {PrePubMed} (http://www.prepubmed.org/grimmer) and currently allows for testing variances, standard deviations, and standard errors for integer data. It is possible to extend the test to other measures of variability such as deviation from the mean, or apply the test to non-integer data such as data reported to halves or tenths. The ability of the test to identify inconsistent statistics relies upon four factors: (1) the sample size; (2) the granularity of the data; (3) the precision (number of decimals) of the reported statistic; and (4) the size of the standard deviation or standard error (but not the variance). The test is most powerful when the sample size is small, the granularity is large, the statistic is reported to a large number of decimal places, and the standard deviation or standard error is small (variance is immune to size considerations). This test has important implications for any field that routinely reports statistics for granular data to at least two decimal places because it can help identify errors in publications, and should be used by journals during their initial screen of new submissions. The errors detected can be the result of anything from something as innocent as a typo or rounding error to large statistical mistakes or unfortunately even fraud. In this report I describe the mathematical foundations of the {GRIMMER} test and the algorithm I use to implement it.},

Participants were asked to select their preferred focus after one trial under each focus condition without knowledge of results. Subsequently, all participants performed two 24-trial blocks, one under each condition, with focus order (preferred first vs. non-preferred) counterbalanced. Significantly more participants preferred the distal compared to the proximal focus. Also, dart throwing accuracy was generally enhanced when participants adopted a distal focus, regardless of focus order or preference.

One component of this hypothesis, relevant beyond the attentional focus effect, suggests that causing individuals to access their self-schema will negatively impact their learning and performance of a motor skill. The purpose of the present two studies was to provide an initial test of the performance and learning aspects of the self-invoking trigger hypothesis by asking participants in one group to think about themselves between trial blocks—presumably activating their self-schema—to compare their performance and learning to that of a control group. In Experiment 1, participants performed 2 blocks of 10 trials on a throwing task. In one condition, participants were asked between blocks to think about their past throwing experience. While a control group maintained their performance across blocks, the self group's performance was degraded on the second block. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to practice a wiffleball hitting task on two separate days. Participants returned on a third day to perform retention and transfer tests without the self-activating manipulation. Results indicated that the self group learned the hitting task less effectively than the control group. The findings reported here provide initial support for the self-invoking trigger hypothesis.},

Participants (N = 56) in the autonomy support groups were asked to choose from three colours of golf balls for each putt during 10 acquisition blocks. Yoked groups were yoked to the golf ball colour choices of their autonomy support group counterparts. Participants in the 100\%-feedback schedule groups were provided x- and y-coordinate {KR} following every putt during acquisition, while participants in the 50\%-faded groups received {KR} after half of their putts, with feedback frequency decreasing over acquisition blocks. All participants completed a 24-h delayed retention and transfer test without {KR}. The results were somewhat consistent with {OPTIMAL} Theory yet the effects were not statistically significant and trivially small. The results were inconsistent with the guidance hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Beyond skill, beliefs in requisite abilities and expectations can affect performance. This study examined effects of induced perceptions of ability to perform well under generic situations of challenge. Participants (N = 31) first completed one block of 20 trials on a throwing accuracy task. They then completed questionnaires ostensibly measuring individual differences in the ability to perform under pressure. Enhanced-expectancy group participants were told that they were well-suited to perform under pressure, while the control group received neutral information. Subsequently, all participants completed another block of 20 trials on the throwing task, with their performance being videotaped and under the assumption that they could secure a prize for themselves and a paired participant with successful performance. Both groups had similar accuracy scores on the first trial block. The enhanced-expectancy group significantly increased their throwing accuracy in the high-pressure situation (second block), whereas the control group showed no change in performance. Furthermore, beliefs regarding performance under challenge predicted throwing accuracy on the second block. The present findings provide evidence that enhancing individuals’ generic expectancies regarding performance under pressure can affect their motor performance.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The Optimizing Performance Through Motivation and Attention for Learning ({OPTIMAL}) theory predicts that providing learners with choices during skill acquisition will enhance their acquisition performance, motor learning, and expectancies. Based on this theory, it is recommended that instructors ask learners to choose which tasks to practice in applied settings. This experiment tested these predictions and recommendation by crossing autonomy support with practice schedule in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Method: Participants (N = 128) practiced a novel non-dominant hand dart-throwing task either with choice over the color of the dart flights (autonomy) or yoked to a counterpart’s choices (yoked). Further, participants either practiced throwing darts to three different targets in equal amounts (variable) or throwing to the same target for all practice trials (constant). All participants completed a pretest, acquisition phase, 24-hr delayed retention and transfer tests, as well as baseline and post-acquisition autonomy, and self-efficacy measures. Data were analyzed according to a pre-registered analysis plan that included pretest and gender as covariates. Results: The autonomy groups reported significantly greater perceived autonomy at the end of acquisition. There were no significant effects of autonomy on self-efficacy, or motor performance uniquely during acquisition, or uniquely on the delayed transfer test. The autonomy groups, however, performed with significantly greater error across acquisition and transfer. Practice schedule interacted with the time of testing such that the constant groups performed significantly more accurately during acquisition but non-significantly less accurately during transfer than the variable groups. Conclusions: These results are inconsistent with {OPTIMAL} theory.},

	abstract = {The self-controlled motor learning literature consists of experiments that compare a group of learners who are provided with a choice over an aspect of their practice environment to a group who are yoked to those choices. A qualitative review of the literature suggests an unambiguous benefit from self-controlled practice. A meta-analysis was conducted on the effects of self-controlled practice on retention test performance measures with a focus on assessing and potentially correcting for selection bias in the literature, such as publication bias and p-hacking. First, a naïve random effects model was fit to the data and a moderate benefit of self-controlled practice, g=.44 (k= 52,N= 3134,95\%{CI}[.31, .56]), was found. Second, publication status was added to the model as a potential moderator, revealing a significant difference between published and unpublished findings, with only the former reporting a benefit of self-controlled practice. Third, to investigate and adjust for the impact of selectively reporting statistically significant results, a weight-function model was fit to the data with a one-tailed p-value cutpoint of .025. The weight-function model revealed substantial selection bias and estimated the true average effect of self-controlled practice as g=.107 (95\%{CI}[.047, .18]). P-curve analyses were conducted on the statistically significant results published in the literature and the outcome suggested a lack of evidential value. Fourth, a suite of sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of these results, all of which converged on trivially small effect estimates. Overall, our results suggest the benefit of self-controlled practice on motor learning is small and not currently distinguishable from zero.},
